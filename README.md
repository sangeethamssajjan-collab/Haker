### Repository: `sangeethamssajjan-collab/Haker`
### Visitor: `sangeethamssajjan-collab` (via the 'jayashreetk55-wq' portal)
### Mission Objective: Pure, unadulterated chaos... and learning, of course.

Hello there, esteemed repository owner!

You may be wondering how this glorious code appeared in your space. Let's just call it a **spontaneous cultural exchange**.

This project, codenamed **xss\_project**, is a highly advanced piece of software designed to... well, mostly prove that if you don't lock your doors, the neighborhood *Haker* might stop by for a minute.

### 🛑 Next Steps (For the Owner)

1.  **Change your locks (Credentials):** The next visitor might not be as friendly. Seriously, look up GitHub Personal Access Tokens (PATs) and use them!
2.  **Laugh/Cry:** Delete this README and the code (or, better yet, turn it into a harmless feature).
3.  **Appreciate the Fun:** Sometimes, you need a rogue commit to remind you to check your permissions!

*Thanks for the temporary residency. It's been real.*
